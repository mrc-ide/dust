    ##' @description
    ##' Create a new model. Note that the behaviour of this object
    ##' created by this function will change considerably based on
    ##' whether the `data_multi` argument is `TRUE`. If not (the
    ##' default) then we create `n_particles` which all share the same
    ##' parameters as specified by the `data` argument. If `data_multi`
    ##' is `TRUE` then `data` must be an unnamed list, and each element
    ##' of it represents a different set of parameters/data. We will
    ##' create `length(data)` *sets* of `n_particles` particles which
    ##' will be simulated together. These particles must have the same
    ##' dimension - that is, they must correspond to model state that
    ##' is the same size.
    ##'
    ##' @param data Data to initialise your model with; a `list`
    ##' object, but the required elements will depend on the details of
    ##' your model. If `data_multi` is `TRUE`, then this must be an
    ##' *unnamed* list of `data` objects (see Details).
    ##'
    ##' @param step Initial step - must be nonnegative
    ##'
    ##' @param n_particles Number of particles to create - must be at
    ##' least 1
    ##'
    ##' @param n_threads Number of OMP threads to use, if `dust` and
    ##' your model were compiled with OMP support (details to come).
    ##' `n_particles` should be a multiple of `n_threads` (e.g., if you use 8
    ##' threads, then you should have 8, 16, 24, etc particles). However, this
    ##' is not compulsary.
    ##'
    ##' @param seed The seed to use for the random number generator. Can
    ##' be a positive integer, `NULL` (initialise with R's random number
    ##' generator) or a `raw` vector of a length that is a multiple of
    ##' 32 to directly initialise the generator (e..g., from the
    ##' [`dust`] object's `$rng_state()` method).
    ##'
    ##' @param data_multi Logical, indicating if `data` should be
    ##' interpreted as a set of different initialisations, and that we
    ##' should prepare `n_particles * length(data)` particles for
    ##' simulation. This has an effect on many of the other methods of
    ##' the object.

    ##' Returns friendly model name

    ##' @description
    ##' Returns parameter information, if provided by the model. This
    ##' describes the contents of data passed to the constructor or to
    ##' `reset` as the `data` argument, and the details depend on the model.
    param = function() {

    ##' @description
    ##' Run the model up to a point in time, returning the filtered state
    ##' at that point.

    ##' step(), silently nothing will happen)
    run = function(step_end) {

    ##' @description
    ##' Set the "index" vector that is used to return a subset of data
    ##' after using `run()`. If this is not used then `run()` returns
    ##' all elements in your state vector, which may be excessive and slower
    ##' than necessary. This method must be called after any
    ##' call to `reset()` as `reset()` may change the size of the state
    ##' and that will invalidate the index.
    ##'
    ##' @param index The index vector - must be an integer vector with
    ##' elements between 1 and the length of the state (this will be
    ##' validated, and an error thrown if an invalid index is given).

    n_threads = function() {

    ##' @description
    ##' Set the "state" vector for all particles, overriding whatever your
    ##' models `initial()` method provides.
    ##'
    ##' @param state The state vector - can be either a numeric vector with the
    ##' same length as the model's current state (in which case the same
    ##' state is applied to all particles), or a numeric matrix with as
    ##' many rows as your model's state and as many columns as you have
    ##' particles (in which case you can set a number of different starting
    ##' states at once).
    ##'
    ##' @param step If not `NULL`, then this sets the initial step. If this
    ##' is a vector (with the same length as the number of particles), then
    ##' particles are started from different initial steps and run up to the
    ##' larges step given (i.e., `max(step)`)

    ##' @description
    ##' Set the 'data' element in a dust object while holding model state,

    ##' Returns the state of the random number generator. This returns a
    ##' raw vector of length 32 * n_particles. This can be useful for
    ##' debugging or for initialising other dust objects.
    ##'
    ##' @param first_only Logical, indicating if we should return only the
    ##' *first* particle's random number state. If `FALSE` (the default)
    ##' all particles states are returned, being 32 bytes per particle.
    ##' If `TRUE` then we take just the first particle's state, which
    ##' will be a total of 32 bytes. Both forms are suitable for seeding
    ##' a new [`dust`] object as the shorter version will be used for
    ##' the first particle, followed by jumps for each subsequent particle.
    rng_state = function(first_only = FALSE) {
    },

    ##' @description Set the random number state for this model. This
    ##' replaces the RNG state that the model is using with a state of
    ##' your choosing, saved out from a different model object. This method
    ##' is designed to support advanced use cases where it is easier to
    ##' manipulate the state of the random number generator than the
    ##' internal state of the dust object.
    ##'
    ##' @param rng_state A random number state, as saved out by the
    ##' `$rng_state()` method. Note that unlike `seed` as passed to the
    ##' constructor, this *must* be a raw vector of the expected length.

    ##' @description
    ##' Returns a logical, indicating if this model was compiled with
    ##' "OpenMP" support, in which case it will react to the `n_threads`
    ##' argument passed to the constructor. This method can also be used
    ##' as a static method by running it directly

    ##' @description
    ##' Change the number of threads that the dust object will use. Your

    ##' effect. Returns (invisibly) the previous value.
    ##'
    ##' @param n_threads The new number of threads to use. You may want to
    ##'   wrap this argument in [dust::dust_openmp_threads()] in order to

    ##'   requested (based on environment variables and OpenMP support).
