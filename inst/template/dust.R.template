##' @title The dust class
##'
##' @description
##'
##' All "dust" dust models are [R6][R6::R6Class] objects and expose a
##'   common set of "methods".  To create a dust model of your own,
##'   see [dust::dust] and to interact with some built-in ones see
##'   [dust::dust_example()]
##'
##' @section Time:
##'
##' For discrete time models, dust has an internal "time", which was
##' called `step` in version `0.11.x` and below.  This must always
##' be non-negative (i.e., zero or more) and always increases in
##' unit increments.  Typically a model will remap this internal
##' time onto a more meaningful time in model space, e.g. by applying
##' the transform `model_time = offset + time * dt`; with this approach
##' you can start at any real valued time and scale the unit increments
##' to control the model dynamics.

    ##' @description
    ##' Create a new model. Note that the behaviour of this object
    ##' created by this function will change considerably based on
    ##' whether the `pars_multi` argument is `TRUE`. If not (the
    ##' default) then we create `n_particles` which all share the same
    ##' parameters as specified by the `pars` argument. If `pars_multi`
    ##' is `TRUE` then `pars` must be an unnamed list, and each element
    ##' of it represents a different set of parameters. We will
    ##' create `length(pars)` *sets* of `n_particles` particles which
    ##' will be simulated together. These particles must have the same
    ##' dimension - that is, they must correspond to model state that
    ##' is the same size.
    ##'
    ##' @param pars Data to initialise your model with; a `list`
    ##' object, but the required elements will depend on the details of
    ##' your model. If `pars_multi` is `TRUE`, then this must be an
    ##' *unnamed* list of `pars` objects (see Details).
    ##'
    ##' @param time Initial time - must be nonnegative
    ##'
    ##' @param n_particles Number of particles to create - must be at
    ##' least 1
    ##'
    ##' @param n_threads Number of OMP threads to use, if `dust` and
    ##' your model were compiled with OMP support (details to come).
    ##' `n_particles` should be a multiple of `n_threads` (e.g., if you use 8
    ##' threads, then you should have 8, 16, 24, etc particles). However, this
    ##' is not compulsory.
    ##'
    ##' @param seed The seed to use for the random number generator. Can
    ##' be a positive integer, `NULL` (initialise with R's random number
    ##' generator) or a `raw` vector of a length that is a multiple of
    ##' 32 to directly initialise the generator (e..g., from the
    ##' [`dust`] object's `$rng_state()` method).
    ##'
    ##' @param pars_multi Logical, indicating if `pars` should be
    ##' interpreted as a set of different initialisations, and that we
    ##' should prepare `n_particles * length(pars)` particles for
    ##' simulation. This has an effect on many of the other methods of
    ##' the object.
    ##'
    ##' @param deterministic Run random number generation deterministically,
    ##' replacing a random number from some distribution with its
    ##' expectation. Deterministic models are not compatible with running on
    ##' a a GPU.
    ##'
    ##' @param gpu_config GPU configuration, typically an integer
    ##' indicating the device to use, where the model has GPU support.
    ##' If not given, then the default value of `NULL` will fall back on the
    ##' first found device if any are available. An error is thrown if the
    ##' device id given is larger than those reported to be available (note
    ##' that CUDA numbers devices from 0, so that '0' is the first device,
    ##' and so on). See the method `$gpu_info()` for available device ids;
    ##' this can be called before object creation as
    ##' `{{name}}$public_methods$gpu_info()`.
    ##' For additional control, provide a list with elements `device_id`
    ##' and `run_block_size`. Further options (and validation) of this
    ##' list will be added in a future version!
    ##'
    ##' @param ode_control For ODE models, control over the integration;
    ##' must be a `dust_ode_control` model, produced by
    ##' [dust::dust_ode_control()]. It is an error to provide a non-`NULL`
    ##' value for discrete time models.

    ##' @description Update one or more components of the model state.

    ##'   then by default we will update the model internal state according

    ##'   to prevent this.
    ##'
    ##' @param pars New pars for the model (see constructor)

    ##' @param time New initial time for the model. If this

    ##' @param state The state vector - can be either a numeric vector with the

    ##' the current time then `NULL` is returned. Otherwise a numeric vector

    ##' Run a particle filter. The interface here will change a lot over the
    ##' next few versions. You *must* reset the dust object using
    ##' `$update_state(pars = ..., time = ...)` before using this method to
    ##' get sensible values.
    ##'
    ##' @param time_end The time to run to. If `NULL`, run to the end
    ##'   of the last data.  This value must be larger than the current
    ##'   model time (`$time()`) and must exactly appear in the data.
    ##'
    ##' @param save_trajectories Logical, indicating if the filtered particle
    ##' trajectories should be saved. If `TRUE` then the `trajectories` element
    ##' will be a multidimensional array (`state x <shape> x time`)
    ##' containing the state values, selected according to the index set
    ##' with `$set_index()`.

    ##' @param time_snapshot Optional integer vector indicating times
    ##' that we should record a snapshot of the full particle filter state.
    ##' If given it must be strictly increasing vector whose elements
    ##' match times given in the `data` object. The return value with be
    ##' a multidimensional array (`state x <shape> x time_snapshot`)
    ##' containing full state values at the requested times.
    ##'
    ##' @param min_log_likelihood Optionally, a numeric value representing
    ##' the smallest likelihood we are interested in. If non-`NULL`
    ##' either a scalar value or vector the same length as the number
    ##' of parameter sets. Not yet supported, and included for future
    ##' compatibility.
