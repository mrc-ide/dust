Description: An Engine for simulation of stochastic models. Includes
    support for running stochastic models in parallel, either with
    shared or varying parameters. Simulations are run efficiently in
    compiled code and can be run with a fraction of simulated states
    returned to R, allowing control over memory usage. Support is
    provided for building bootstrap particle filter for performing
    Sequential Monte Carlo (e.g., Gordon et al. 1993
    <doi:10.1049/ip-f-2.1993.0015>). The core of the simulation engine is
    the 'xoshiro256**' algorithm (Blackman and Vigna
    <arXiv:1805.01407>), and the package is further described in
    FitzJohn et al 2021 <doi:10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16466.2>.
